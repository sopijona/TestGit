            <div class="box" style="text-align: center;"><strong><b>PHOTO</b></strong><br><br>
                The word photograph was coined <br> 
                in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based <br> 
                on the Greek φῶς (phos), meaning <br> 
                "light," and γραφή (graphê), meaning "drawing, <br> 
                writing," together meaning "drawing with <br> 
                light."

            <div class="box" style="text-align: center;"><strong><b>ART</b></strong><br><br><br>
                Art is the expression of ideas <br>
                and emotions through a physical medium,<br>
                like painting, sculpture, film, dance,<br>
                writing, photography, or theatre.</div>
            <div class="box"style="text-align: center;"><strong><b>DETAILS</b></strong><br><br>
                Detail photography is all <br>
                about capturing images often, but not <br>
                exclusively, inanimate <br>
                objects that help further define your brand. <br>
                These shots are designed to <br>
                reveal more about who you are, your interests,<br> 
                and even the tools of your trade.

            <div class="box"style="text-align: center;"><strong><b>INSPIRE</b></strong><br><br>
                As photographers, we can be <br>
                inspired by many things before clicking the shutter <br>
                on a scene or subject to capture a <br>
                moment in time. It could be the <br>
                light falling on a scene or the <br>
                look in someone's eyes. It might be the time of day <br>
                or the time of year.Maybe it's <br>
                a combination of a lens <br>
                choice and a situation.

            <div class="box"style="text-align: center;"><strong><b>DIMENSION</b></strong><br><br> 
                Dimension in photography adds a <br>
                lifelike or realistic quality to an image this <br>
                is also called depth of field. <br>
                It feels like it's two- or three-dimensional, <br>
                like you could reach out and grab it. <br>
                I'll share a few ways to add dimension <br>
                to your images using certain lenses, as well <br>
                as aperture, distance, and framing.

            <div class="box"style="text-align: center;"><strong><b>CREATIVITY</b></strong><br><br> 
                Creative photography is a <br>
                technique by which you combine different shapes,<br>
                colors, and forms of ordinary moments and turn <br>
                them into creative arts using 
                your photography skills.
